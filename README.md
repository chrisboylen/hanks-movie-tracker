# Hanky Panky

This project is working off the [Movie DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)  
The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. It has functionality allowing users to view Tom Hanks Movies. Users can favorite movies, click them to see more information, and view them later under the favorites button.

The main goal of this project was to learn about how to implement Redux and React-Router in a application built using React.

Using Postgres as a backend, we set up a separate client-side application (use create-react-app), to sit alongside this one.

Collaborators include [Chris Boyen](https://github.com/chrisboylen "Chris Boyen"), [Tom King](https://github.com/"tomkingkong") and [Megan Haubelt](https://github.com/Haub "Megan Haubelt").
