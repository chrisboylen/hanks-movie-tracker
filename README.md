# Movie Tracker

This project is working off the [Movie DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)  
The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies.

Using Postgres as a backend, we set up a separate client-side application (use create-react-app), to sit alongside this one.

Collaborators include [Chris Boyen](https://github.com/chrisboylen "Chris Boyen"), [Tom King](https://github.com/"tomkingkong") and [Megan Haubelt](https://github.com/Haub "Megan Haubelt").
